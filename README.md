# AdventOfCode2021

My first ever time trying Zig! Let's see if we can solve every problem, and as a bonus, use only the standard library.

To build:
```
zig build
```

To run (in this example, run day 1a and 1b):
```
zig build run -- 1a 1b
```

To test a specific day:
```
zig test src/day01.zig
```
